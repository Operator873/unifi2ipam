# 1. Sync Mode (default): Updates phpIPAM based on MAC addresses. If a device is found,
#     it's updated. If not, it's created.
# 2. Nuke and Pave Mode (--nuke-and-pave): Deletes all addresses in all configured
#     subnets in phpIPAM and then creates fresh records for every client found in UniFi.

# Required Environment Variables:
# - UNIFI_API_KEY: Your API key for the UniFi Network Controller.
# - IPAM_API_KEY: Your API key for the phpIPAM application.
